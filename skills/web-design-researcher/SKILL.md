# Web Design Researcher

## Overview
Use this skill to run design research on competitor or reference sites and deliver a structured report.

## Workflow
1. Define scope and target sites (5-10). If not provided, propose a list and confirm.
2. For each site, capture: IA and navigation, onboarding, dashboard layout, transactions, security cues, theming, and responsiveness.
3. Record evidence: URLs, capture date, and short notes. Add screenshots when possible.
4. Synthesize cross-site patterns, strengths and weaknesses, and actionable recommendations.
5. Deliver to Notion (preferred) or as Markdown if Notion is not available.

## Output format
- Use the template in references/research-template.md.
- Include a comparison table and prioritized recommendations.

## Notes
- Do not copy private assets; only use publicly visible content.
